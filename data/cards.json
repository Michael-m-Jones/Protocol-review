EYEOPENING \u2022 Spontaneous: Eyeopening is spontaneous if the patient\u2019seyes are already open at the time of the assessment with no stimulati on other thanth at of the existing ambient environment. The patientcan closehis eyes to comm and. Thiseye opening response implies an intact reticular activating mechanism and a functioning arousal mechanism. \u2022 To Voice: If the patient\u2019seyes are not open at the time of the assessment, a response to voice is present if the eyesopen when the patient\u2019sname is spoken or shouted. \u2022 To Pain: If verbal stimulati on is unsuccessful in elicitingeye opening, a response to pain is present if the eyesopen when a standard painstimulus is applied. \u2022 None: No eyeresponse is present if the above attempts at stimulati on are unsuccessful. II. BESTVERBAL RESPONSE \u2022 Oriented: After being aroused, the patient is asked name, place and date. The patient is oriented if the answersg iven are correct. \u2022 Confused: The patient is confused if the individual cannot answer the questions regarding, name, place and dateaccurately, but is still capable of producing phrases, sentences or conversati on exchanges. \u2022 Inappropriate: In thisstate, the patient cannot produce phrases, sentences or conversational exchanges, butcan produce an intact word or two. These wordsmay be electable only in response to physical stimulati on and mayfrequently be obscenities or relative\u2019snames. \u2022 Incomprehensible: In thisstate, the patientcan produceg roans, moans or unintelligible mumblings, butcannot produce an intact word in response to stimulati on. \u2022 None: In thisstate, the patient does not respond with anyphonati on to anystimulati on no matterhow prolonged or repeated. III. BESTMOTOR RESPONSE \u2022 Obedient: In response to instructions, whether verbal or written, or throughg estures, patient shows ability to comprehend the instructi on and to physically execute it. A comm on example is the comm and to holdup twofingers. \u2022 Purposeful: When a standard painful stimulus is applied, the patientmay movelimb or bodyaway from stimulus in a purposeful manner or attempt to pushstimulus away. \u2022 Withdrawal: If the patient does not obeycommands, the standard painstimulus is applied. Withdrawal is present if 1) the elbow flexes, 2) the movement is rapid, 3) there is no muscle stiffness and 4) the arm is drawn away from the trunk. \u2022 Flexi on: Flexi on is present if 1) the elbow flexes, 2) the movement is slow, 3) muscle stiffness is present, 4) the forearm and hand are heldagainst the body and 5) the limbs hold a hemiplegic positi on. G LASGOW COMASCALE \u2022 Extensi on: Extensi on is present if 1) the legs and armsextend, 2) muscle stiffness is present and 3) external rotati on of the shoulder and forearm occurs. \u2022 None: Maximum standard painstimulati on produces no mot or response.
